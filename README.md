# LuaOTP

This module is part of a chain of OTP libraries all written in different languages. See https://github.com/OTPLibraries

A simple One Time Password (OTP) library in lua

Compatible with Authy and Google Authenticator. Full support for QR code url is provided.


## Libraries Needed

No external libraries/jars are required to use any version of JOTP.


## Configuration

Add the whole package into your project or jar it. Leave out the Main.java file, as this is a test file.


## Description

This was actually a spawn off pyotp, but I would necessarily say the code was copied. Things in python aren't in lua, therefore I had to make the methods myself. However, credits will go to the module for providing a guideline of what to do. [Here](https://github.com/pyotp/pyotp) you can find pyotp and realize how different it really is.

## Usage

To use this library, pick either TOTP or HOTP then use the provided files - giving the functions what they need. The only thing you really need to pay attention is settings. Check out the test file, as it will tell you what the default requirements is for Google Authenticator, but you should always be using Authy (it is the most lenient).


## TODO

* Optimize the whole thing. The code was translated and is still very messy. Could probably use some improvements in the hacked areas.
* Add comments - there are NO comments, should match up to COTP's style
